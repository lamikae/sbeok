SBEOK is a small shell script to ensure a wav file length is CD audio
compliant. When burning an audio disc where the audio is continuous over 
a track change, the wav data length should be an exact multiple of audio 
CD sector length.

The Red Book audio CD specification defines a sector length of 1/75 sec.
If the audio data does not fill up the last sector, the burner will insert
silence to fill out the sector. This may be enough to cause an annoying
click in some CD players, called a sector boundary error (SBE).

The program is a single shell script file ready to be dropped onto $PATH,
and requires no dependencies apart from bash.
