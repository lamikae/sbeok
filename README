SBEOK is a small shell script to check whether the audio data length 
of a wav file is an exact multiple of audio cd sector length.

When burning an audio cd where the audio is continuous over a track change,
you need to ensure the proper length of each track to prevent small clicks.

On audio cd, tracks begin at full sectors. The Red Book audio cd specification
defines a sector length of 1/75 sec. If the audio data does not fill up,
the cd burner will insert silence to fill out the sector. This is enough 
to cause an annoying click in some cd players, which is called a 
sector boundary error (SBE).

A single audio sector is 2352 bytes.
(16 bits * 44100 1/sec * 2 channels * 1/75 sec * 1/8 bytes/bit).
The check is done by calculating the remainder of "data_bytes mod 2352".

To get the audio data bytes, `sndfile-info` from sndfile-programs is used
(exact package name may vary by distribution).
