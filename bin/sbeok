Checks whether the audio data length of a wav file is an exact
multiple of audio cd sector length in case of sector boundary errors (SBE).

A single audio sector is 2352 bytes.
(16 bits * 44100 1/sec * 2 channels * 1/75 sec * 1/8 bytes/bit).
File audio length is appropriate for Red Book audio CD when 
 "data length modulo sector size" is zero.

`sndfile-info` is used to get the audio data bytes count from the input files.
On Debian/Ubuntu, this is in package sndfile-programs.

SBEOK $VERSION
Checks whether an audio wav track will not expose
  sector boundary error on audio CD.

USAGE
	sbeok [files(s) ...]

When burning an audio cd where the audio is continuous over a track change,
you need to ensure the proper length of each track to prevent small clicks.

On audio cd, tracks begin at full sectors. The Red Book audio cd specification
defines a sector length of 1/75 sec. If the audio data does not fill up,
the cd burner will insert silence to fill out the sector. This is enough 
to cause an annoying click in some cd players, which is called a 
sector boundary error (SBE). A single audio sector is 2352 bytes.

Give a list of .wav files as a parameter to check if it properly fills to sector boundary.
